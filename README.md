# Artificial Intelligence EAFIT

Hey, welcome! This is my AI repository. I've got a bunch of AI algorithms lined up for ya. The whole point of this is to share the knowledge I've been gathering and get some feedback on my work.

Let's do it!

# The Perceptron

Perceptrons were among the first neural network models used for computation, and they provide the foundation for the more intricate and deep networks that exist in the present day.

## Biological Neural Works

A biological neural network, such as the one in our brain, is made up of numerous nerve cells called neurons. These neurons receive electrical signals, or impulses, from nearby neurons through dendrites. If the total of these incoming signals surpasses a specific threshold, the neuron will "fire" its own signal through long axon fibers that link up to the dendrites of other neurons. The point of contact between two neurons is referred to as a synapse. On average, each neuron is connected to roughly 7,000 synapses, which illustrates the high level of connectivity within our brain's network. As we develop new associations between two concepts, the synaptic strength between the neurons representing these concepts is strengthened, according to Hebb's rule (1949) which states, "Cells that fire together wire together."
