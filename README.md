# Artificial Intelligence EAFIT

Hey, welcome! This is my AI repository. I've got a bunch of AI algorithms lined up for ya. The whole point of this is to share the knowledge I've been gathering and get some feedback on my work.

Let's do it!

# The Perceptron

Perceptrons were among the first neural network models used for computation, and they provide the foundation for the more intricate and deep networks that exist in the present day.

## Biological Neural Works

A biological neural network, found in the human brain, is made up of nerve cells called neurons. These neurons receive electrical signals from their neighboring neurons through dendrites. Once the sum of these signals reaches a certain threshold, the neuron releases its own electrical signal via axons that are connected to the dendrites of other neurons. The point of contact between two neurons is called a synapse, with each neuron typically connected to around 7,000 synapses. As we learn new associations between concepts, the synaptic strength between the neurons representing these concepts is strengthened according to Hebbâ€™s rule (1949), which states "Cells that fire together wire together".
